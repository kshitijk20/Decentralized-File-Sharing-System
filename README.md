# Decentralized File Sharing System

Welcome to the Decentralized File Sharing System project! In this project, we'll be creating our own decentralized file system, similar to Google Drive but built on blockchain technology. Users can upload, share, and manage their files in a decentralized and secure manner.

## Project Overview

This project aims to demonstrate the power of blockchain and decentralized technologies in file storage and access. Our Decentralized File Sharing System will include the following features:

- **Connected Account**: Connect your Ethereum wallet (e.g., MetaMask) to our decentralized Google Drive.
- **Upload Files**: Upload your images securely to the IPFS network, ensuring decentralized file storage.
- **Access Sharing**: Grant access to specific addresses to view and access your uploaded images.
- **Revoking Access**: Revoke access from addresses that you previously granted access to.
- **Secure Transactions**: All transactions are recorded on the blockchain, ensuring transparency and security.

## Technologies Used

- **Smart Contracts**: Ethereum smart contracts written in Solidity to handle access control and transactions.
- **ReactJS**: Frontend development using React for user interaction and UI.
- **IPFS**: Decentralized file storage using the InterPlanetary File System.
- **Ether.js**: A library for interacting with Ethereum blockchain and smart contracts.
- **Hardhat**: Development environment and tools for Ethereum and smart contract development.

## Getting Started

1. Clone this repository: `git clone <repository-url>`
2. Install dependencies: `npm install`
3. Set up your Ethereum wallet (MetaMask) and connect to a testnet or the Ethereum mainnet.
4. Start the React app: `npm start`

## Project Structure

- `contracts/`: Solidity smart contracts for access control and transactions.
- `src/`: React frontend components and UI.
- `scripts/`: Deployment and other utility scripts.
- `hardhat.config.js`: Configuration for the Hardhat development environment.

## Usage

1. Connect your Ethereum wallet to the app.
2. Upload images to your decentralized Google Drive.
3. Share access with specific Ethereum addresses.
4. Revoke access when needed.

## Future Enhancements

- Implement advanced access control mechanisms.
- Enhance user interface and user experience.
- Integrate with other blockchain networks.
- Add file encryption and privacy features.

## Conclusion

By the end of this project, you'll have a working prototype of a decentralized file sharing application, showcasing the capabilities of blockchain and decentralized technologies in the realm of file storage and access control. We encourage you to explore, experiment, and contribute to the project's growth!
